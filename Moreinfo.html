        <h1>Who is Jillian?</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a rising senior at <span style="color:green;font-size:30px;">Washington University </span>
            and I'm originally from <span style="color:blue;font-size:30px;">San Diego</span> California
        </p>
        <p>Fun fact: I've ridden horses since I was five years old because I'm allergic to cats and dogs and wanted a pet!</p>
